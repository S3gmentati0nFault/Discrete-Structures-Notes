\chapter{The basics}
\begin{definition}[Graph]
    A graph is a pair $(V, E)$ of finite disjoint sets where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $V$ is the set of vertices
        \item $E$ is a set of pairs, $E \subseteq \binom{V}{2}\footnote{The binomial coefficient has an interpretation in the field of combinatorics: it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that $k$ objects can be chosen among $n$ objects. More formally: it defines the number of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set.} = \{(u, v): u \neq v, \text{with } u, v \in V\}.$
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
As a default, for the rest of the course, we will be considering simple graphs, which means that between any two $u, v$ vertices, there cannot be more than one edge. Moreover, between any vertex $v$ and himself, there cannot be an edge.

We say that two vertices are adjacent if $\{u, v\} \in E$, an edge $\{u, v\} \in E$ is always incident to its extremes. Any edge will be named, by convention, using the labels for its extremes e.g. $\{u, v\}$ is translated to $uv$.

\begin{definition}[Neighbour]
    Given $u, v \in V$ two adjacent vertices, $v$ is neighbour of $u$. The set of neighbours of $u$ is called the neighbourhood of $u$ and we denote it with $\ngbrs{u}$. The degree of $u$ is $\deg{u} = |\ngbrs{u}|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Order]
    The order of $G$ is $n(G) = |V|$ and the size of the graph is $e(G) = |E|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Subgraph]
    Given two graphs $G, H$: We say $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ if $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$ and $E(H) \subseteq E(G)$, we denote this by saying that $H \subseteq G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Induced subgraph]
    A subgraph $H$ of $G$ is induced if, for any $u, v \in V(H), uv \in E(H) \iff u, v \in V(G)$
\end{definition}

For any $U \subseteq V(G)$ we write $G[U]$ for the subgraph $G$ induced by $U$, that is:

$V(G[U]) = U$

and

$E(G[U]) = \{vw \in E(G): v, w \in U\}$

We can also define the difference between two graphs as:

\begin{equation*}
    G - U = G[V(G) \setminus U]
\end{equation*}
Given $F \subseteq E(G)$, we write $G - F$ for the graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G) \setminus F$.

\begin{definition}[Complement]
    The complement of $G$, denoted $\overline{G}$ is the graph on vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $\binom{V}{2} \setminus E(G)$
\end{definition}
Usually in graph theory we derive three measures from the concept of vertex degree
\begin{definition}[Maximum degree]
    The maximum degree inside a graph can be defined as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        \maxd = \max_{v \in V(G)}\deg{v}
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Average degree]
    The average degree inside a graph can be defined as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        \avgd = \frac{1}{|V(G)|}\sum_{v \in V(G)}\deg{v}
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Minumum degree]
    The minimum degree inside a graph can be defined as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        \mind = \min_{v \in V(G)}\deg{v}
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[$r$-regular graph]
    A graph is $r$-regular if $\deg{v} = r \forall v \in V(G)$. $G$ is just regular if it is regular for some $r \in \N$
\end{definition}

Now we will prove a very important lemma
\begin{lemma}[Handshaking Lemma]
    Let $G$ be a graph, then $2e(G) = \sum_{v \in V(G)}\deg{v}$ and $G$ has an even number of odd degree vertices.
\end{lemma}
\begin{prf}
    Let $S$ be the set of pairs $(v, e)$ where $v \in V(G)$ and $e \in E(G)$, which is incident to $v$.

    For any $v \in V(G)$, the number of pairs of the form $(v, e) \in S$ is $\deg{v}$, therefore:
    \begin{equation*}
        |S| = \sum_{v \in V(G)}\deg{v}
    \end{equation*}
    For any edge $e \in E(G)$, the number of pairs of the form $(v, e) \in S$ is $2$, thus
    \begin{equation*}
        |S| = 2|E(G)|
    \end{equation*}
    The two expressions have to be the same, this implies that
    \begin{equation*}
        \sum_{v \in V(G)}\deg{v} = 2|E(G)|
    \end{equation*}
    Since $\sum_{v \in V(G)}\deg{v}$ is even, then the sum contains an even number of odd terms. \qed
\end{prf}
\begin{pipo}
    Any graph $G$ is the subgraph of a $\maxd$-regular graph.
\end{pipo}
\begin{prf}
    We reason by induction on $k = \maxd - \mind$

    \boldmath $k = 0$ \unboldmath
    
    $G$ is regular and $G \subseteq G$
    
    \boldmath $k > 0$ \unboldmath

    Let $G'$ be a disjoint copy of $G$, let $W$ and $W'$ be the sets of minimum degree vertices in $G$ and $G'$, respectively.

    For any vertex $w \in W$, add an edge from $w$ to the corresponding vertex $w' \in W'$.

    Iterate the process until all the corresponding vertices from $W$ and $W'$ have been linked by an edge, we can conclude the following:

    Let $H$ be the resulting graph:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $G \subseteq H$
        \item For each $w \in W$ we have $\deg[H]{w} = \deg{w} + 1 = \mind + 1$
        \item For each $w' \in W'$ we have $\deg[H]{w'} = \deg[G']{w} + 1 = \mind[G'] + 1$
        \item For each $v \in V(H) \setminus (W \cup W')$ we have:
        \begin{equation*}
            \deg[H]{v} =
            \begin{cases}
                &\deg{v} \text{\hspace{5mm}if } v \in G\\
                &\deg[G']{v} \text{\hspace{5mm}if } v \in G'
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
    Thus $\maxd[H] = \maxd$ and $\mind[H] = \mind + 1$
    By the induction hypthesis there is a graph $H'$ such that $H'$ is $\maxd[H]$-regular and $H \subseteq H' \implies G \subseteq H \subseteq H'$ and $H'$ is $\maxd$-regular \qed
