\begin{definition}[Hamilton cycle]
    Let $G$ be a graph, an Hamilton cycle in $G$ is a spanning cycle and an Hamilton path is a spanning path.
\end{definition}
We say $G$ is Hamiltonian if it contains an Hamilton cycle. The following is the sufficient condition for hamiltonicity.
\begin{customtheorem}{Dirac}
\label{theorem:dirac}
    Let $G$ be a graph on $n \geq 3$ vertices, with $\mind \geq \frac{n}{2}$. Then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
\end{customtheorem}
\begin{prf}
    Note $G$ is connected, since otherwise $G$ woudl have a component of size $\leq \frac{n}{2}$ and the vertices in that component would have degree $\leq \frac{n}{2} - 1$.

    Let $P = v_0v_1\dots v_l$ be a maximum path in $G$, by maximality, we know that $\ngbrs{v_0}, \ngbrs{v_l} \subseteq \v[P]$. If $v_0v_l \in \e$ then $P + v_0v_l$ is a cycle $\cycl$ in $G$ with $\v[\cycl] = \v[P]$. Otherwise, let $I \subseteq \{1, \dots, l - 1\}$ be the set of $i$ such that $v_lv_i \in \e, |I| \geq \mind = \frac{n}{2}$.

    Recall $\ngbrs{v_0} \subseteq \{v_1, \dots, v_{l - 1}\}$ where $|\{v_1, \dots, v_{l - 1}\}| \leq n - 2$. So $v_0$ has $< n - 2 - \frac{n}{2} = \frac{n}{2} - 2$ non neighbours in $\{v_1, \dots, v_{l - 1}\}$. Thus there is $i \in I$ such that $v_{i + 1} \in \ngbrs{v_0}$, thus we have a cycle $\cycl = v_0v_1 \dots v_iv_lv_{l - 1} \dots v_{i + 1}v_0$ in $G$ with $\v[\cycl] = \v[P]$.

    Since $G$ is connected, then if $\v[\cycl] \neq \v[G]$ then we have a vertex $v \in \v \setminus \v[\cycl]$ with a neighbour on $\cycl$. Let $w'$ be a neighbour of $w$ on $\cycl$. Now $vw\cycl w'$ is a path in $G$ with one more vertex than $P$. This contradicts the maximality of $P$ so $\v[\cycl] = \v$. This means that $\cycl$ is an Hamilton cycle.\qed
\end{prf}
Recall that an independent set in $G$ is a set of pairwise non adjacent vertices. The independence number $\ind$ is the maximum size of an independent set in $G$ (we recall that $K(G)$ is the connectivity).
\begin{customtheorem}{5.2}
\label{theorem:5.2}
    If we have a graph $G$ on $\geq 3$ vertices, if $\ind \leq K(G)$ then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
\end{customtheorem}
\begin{definition}[Degree sequence]
    Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with degrees $d_1 \leq d_2 \leq \dots \leq d_n$ then the $n$-tuple $d_1 \dots d_n$ is the degree sequence of $G$.
\end{definition}
An $n$-tuple $d_1 \dots d_n$ with $d_1 \leq \dots \leq d_n$ is Hamiltonian if any graph with degree sequnce pointwise greater than $d_1 \dots d_n$ is Hamiltonian. $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ Hamiltonian if all $n$-vertex $G$ with degree sequence pointwise greater than $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ is Hamiltonian.
\begin{customproposition}{5.2}
\label{proposition:5.2}
    Any $G$ on $n \geq 3$ vertices with $\ind \leq k(G)$ is Hamiltonian.
\end{customproposition}
\begin{prf}
    Suppose not and let $\cycl$ be a cycle of max length in $G$ and let $u \in \v \setminus \v[\cycl]$ let $F$ be a maximum $U - \cycl$ fan.

    Note that $\cycl$ exists since $n \geq 3$ implies either any $3$ vertices form a cycle or there is an independent set of size $2$ which means that $k(G) \geq \ind \geq 2$ in which case we also have a cycle. Denote $C = v_1v_2 \dots v_l$ and let $I = \{i \in [l]: F$ contains a $u-v_i$ path $\}$.

    By \ref{theorem:menger}'s theorem the number of paths in $F$ is
    \begin{equation}
        \label{equation:1_5.2}
        |I| \geq min\{k(G), |\cycl|\}
    \end{equation}
    if there is $i \in [l]$ such that both $i, i + 1 \in I$ then we obtain a cycle $v_{i + 1} \cycl v_i F u F v_{i + 1}$ which contradicts the maximality of $\cycl$ thus $|I| < |\cycl|$ thus \ref{equation:1_5.2} implies $|I| \geq k(G)$.

    If $i, j \in I$ such that $v_{i + 1}v_{j + 1} \in \e$, then we obtain a new cycle $v_{j + 1} \cycl v_i F u F v_j \cycl v_{i + 1}$ which contradicts the maximality of $\cycl$. So $\{i + 1: i \in I\}$ is an independent set of size $|I| \geq k(G) \geq \ind$ of size $I \geq k(G) \geq \alpha(G)$ which means that $|J| = \alpha(G)$.

    But note $J \cap I = \emptyset$ by the above, then, by maximality of $F$, we have $uv_{i + 1} \notin \e$ for each $i + 1 \in J$ then $J \cup \{u\}$ is an independent set of size $\alpha(G) + 1$.\qed
\end{prf}
\begin{customtheorem}{ChvÃ¡tal}
\label{theorem:chvatal}
    Let $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ be an integer sequence with $0 \leq a_1 \leq \dots \leq a_n \leq n - 1$ and $n \geq 3$ then $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ is Hamiltonian if and only if
    \begin{equation}
        \label{equation:1_chvatal}
        \fa i < \frac{n}{2} \st a_n \leq i \implies a_{n - i} \geq n - i
    \end{equation}
\end{customtheorem}
Note that \ref{theorem:dirac}'s theorem gives that $(\cel{\frac{n}{2}}, \dots, \cel{\frac{n}{2}})$ is Hamiltonian.
\begin{prf}
    To prove this theorem we have to prove the two different directions separately.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [($\impliedby$)] Let $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ be an integer sequence as in the statement satisfying \ref{equation:1_chvatal}, let's suppose for a contradiction it's not Hamiltonian. This means that there is an $n$-vertex $G$ with degree sequence $(d_1, \dots, d_n)$ such that $d_i \geq a_i \fa i \in [n]$ and $G$ has no Hamiltonian cycle. We take such a $G$ with $\ne$ maximum. Note $(d_1, \dots, d_n)$ satisfies \ref{equation:1_chvatal}.
        
        Let $x \neq y \in \v$ be non adjacent vertices with $d(x) \leq d(y)$ and $d(x) + d(y)$ is maximum. We can find these two vertices because if we couldn't we would have a complete graph and thus an Hamilton cycle, by \ref{theorem:dirac}'s theorem. Note that the degree sequence of $G + xy$ is pointwise greater than $(d_1, \dots, d_n)$ and so than $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ then by maximality of $\ne$ implies that $G + xy$ contains an Hamilton cycle $v_1v_2 \dots v_n$ where $v_1 = x$ and $v_n = y$.

        Note that $v_1v_2 \dots v_1$  is a Hamilton path in $G$. let $I = \{i \in [n]: xv_{i + 1} \in \e\}$ and $J = \{i \in [n]: yv_i \in \e\}$. Same argument as \ref{theorem:dirac}'s proof: $\fa i \in J, i \notin I$ otherwise $v_1 v_{i + 1} v_{i + 2} \dots v_n v_i v_{i - 1} \dots v_1$ is a Hamilton cycle in $G$ (not using $xy = v_1v_n$ anymore) and that is absurd.

        From that comes that $I \cap J = \emptyset \implies |I \cup J| = d(x) + d(y) \leq n - 1$, because $I \subseteq \{1, \dots, n - 2\}$ and $J \subseteq \{2, \dots, n - 1\}$.

        We will now define an $h$ value as follows:
        \begin{equation*}
            h := d(x) \leq \frac{n - 1}{2} < \frac{n}{2}
        \end{equation*}
        We showed that $v_i \in \ngbrs{y} \fa i \in I$, id est $v_i$ and $y$ are not adjacent, so the maximality of $d(x) + d(y)$ implies that $d(v_i) \leq d(x) = h$.

        In other words, $I$ is a set of $|I| = d(x) = h$ indices $i$ such that $d(v_i) \leq h$ which means that there are $h + 1$ vertices of degree $\leq h \implies x $ and the ones indexed by $I$. So $d_h \leq h \implies$ \ref{equation:1_chvatal} implies that $d_{n - h} \geq n - h$, this means that we have a degree sequence like this:
        \begin{equation*}
            (\underbrace{\leq h, \leq h, \dots, \leq h, \leq h}_\text{$h + 1$ times}, \dots, \underbrace{\geq n - h, \geq n - h, \dots, \geq n - h, \geq n - h}_\text{$h + 1$ times})
        \end{equation*}
        Which means that there are $h + 1$ vertices with degree $\geq n - h$, since $d(x) = h, \ex z \in \v$ with $d(z) \geq n - h$ such that $xz \notin \e$, but $d(x) + d(z) \geq h + (n - h) = n > d(x) + d(y)$ contradicting the maximality of $d(x) + d(y)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{prf}
