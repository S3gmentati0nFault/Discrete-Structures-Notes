# Discrete-Structures-Notes
## Introduction
This is the open source alternative to the notes used by Professor Bertille and Professor Joos for the course of Discrete Structures 1 at University of Heidelberg. I came up with the idea of making my own version of the notes because the ones associated with the course are closed source and the students do not own the notes in their entirety.
<br>
This repository contains my spin of the noes, they are still under review and they are far from finished. They are basically merging:
- Lecture notes
- Internet informations
- Notes from other courses
- Information from the manual "Graph Theory"
<br>
Since the material has not been officially reviewed yet I would urge anyone to use it actively instead of reading passively, any error hereby contained should be rectified by the reader or by myself directly, if you want to cooperate you should read the following.

## Contributions
If you find errors or you want to make additions you should abide the following simple rules:
1. If you found very small errors (e.g. a couple of typos), you can open an issue and tell me clearly where the problems lie, I can easily take care of them.
2. If you found a lot of errors, you should definitely create your own fork of the repository, correct it and send me a pull request.
3. if you want to add content, whatever the reason, before creating your fork you should talk about it with me (read the contacts section), I am not going to accept pull requests for additional content that is not in the corpus of the teaching.


Any modification of the source code should be keeping in mind just a few simple rules:
- Use commands as much as possible to make the source code uniform.
- If a new file is needed for source code put it in the <code>/src</code> folder and name it in such a way that can be understood what it contains.
- The same goes for .tikz images (they have to go into the <code>/img</code> folder) and the name should be telling.
- Any other configurations for tikz that can be useful in more than one spot inside the source code should be added to the <code>\tikzset</code> directive I included in the <code>/src/preamble.sty</code> file.
<br>
If you want to contribute but you have no idea on where to start just check the <code>TODO.md</code> file, there is a ton of fixes to go through!

## Contacts
If you want to contact me you should defenetely either send me an email via <a href="mailto:alessandro.biagiotti@studenti.unimi.it">alessandro.biagiotti@studenti.unimi.it</a> or you can write me a message over on Telegram <a href="http://t.me/AlexBgtt">@AlexBgtt</a>.

## License
At the moment the license for this project is set to MIT but I am wondering if it would be nice to change it because I would like for this repository to be as close to official as possible and I would also like to have my work acknowledged by any future versions of the repository that may improve the quality of the proposed material.
