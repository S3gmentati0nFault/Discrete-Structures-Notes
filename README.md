# Discrete-Structures-Notes
## Introduction
This is the open source alternative to the notes used by Professor Bertille and Professor Joos for the course of discrete structures 1. The idea arose from the fact that the version of the lecture notes students are given during the course is just a list of theorems and propositions, which is not enough.<br>
This is my version of the notes and is clearly still work in progress, I want to get it ready before the end of the year though.
This version is just a digitalization of my notes with some additions from both book and internet where the lecture notes were not enough; since the material has not been officially reviewed yet I would ask anyone using the material to use it actively instead of reading passively, any error hereby contained should be rectified by the reader or by myself directly, more about this later.

## Contributions
I would really love to receive contributions to make the materials for this course the best possible alternative to the book, if possible open your pull request and make whatever changes you would like to see featured inside the main version of the lecture notes, if you are not comfortable with the use of Github you can just send me notes in whatever form is easier for you to <a href="mailto:alessandro.biagiotti@studenti.unimi.it">alessandro.biagiotti@studenti.unimi.it</a>.<br>
Any modification of the source code should be keeping in mind just a few simple rules:
  - Use commands as much as possible to make the source code uniform.
  - If a new file is needed for source code put it in the <code>/src</code> folder and name it in such a way that can be understood what it contains.
  - The same goes for .tikz images (they have to go into the <code>/img</code> folder) and the name should be telling.
  - Any other configurations for tikz that can be useful in more than one spot inside the source code should be added to the <code>\tikzset</code> directive I included in the <code>/src/preamble.sty</code> file.

Anything wrong with the code, any requests or suggestions, should pass through this repository's issues or through my mailbox.
